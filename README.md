# i-like-trains
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/GunnarHorve/i-like-trains.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/GunnarHorve/i-like-trains)

**i-like-trains** is a departure board visualizer for the various train stations scattered throughout the MBTA-controlled region.  It is a project for fun, and, honestly, just an excuse to play with [travis](https://travis-ci.org/getting_started) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for the first time.

As such:  this project is [built by travis-ci](https://travis-ci.com/github/GunnarHorve/i-like-trains) and deployed to [https://gunnarhorve.github.io/i-like-trains/](https://gunnarhorve.github.io/i-like-trains/).

Because my last project was vanilla JS, this one is written with React, specifically, the standard [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) stack.

### Development - `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Testing - `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


### Building - `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
